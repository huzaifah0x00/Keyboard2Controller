### This repository is archived because I bought a controller :')

  '"Keyboard2Controller" Is A Program that lets you play games which require a controller on PC  (fifa for example) , using another PC/laptop  as a second controller '

run server.py on server PC
and client.py on client PC

that's it 
and of course .. you have to install <a href="vjoystick.sourceforge.net/site/index.php/download-a-install/download">vjoy</a> for this to work
